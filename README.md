# Steganography Challenge

Welcome to the **Steganography Challenge**! 🕵️‍♂️

This project is a fun, interactive quiz that tests your skills in **steganography** — the art of hiding information inside media files like images, audio, and video.

You will be given several files to download, and your task is to find hidden clues or answers inside them. Each question allows you to input your answer directly on the page and get immediate feedback.

## 🚨 Disclaimers
- **Do not use reverse image search or online tools** to find the answers. The challenge is meant to test your observation and investigative skills.
- This is a client-side project, so answers are validated using cryptographic hashes for safety and fun.
